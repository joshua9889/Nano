>The micro end of the cable connects to the Fusion via the USB-Micro port on the side of the controller. This port is for power only and does not transfer any data. The standard USB-A end of the cable connects to the computer or power supply capable of 5V at a minimum of 500mA.

Once connected, a green LED near the Micro USB port will illuminate to show that the Fusion is connected to power.

## **Try Another USB-A port**
>If the USB LED is not turning on when the USB cable is connected, try connecting the USB-A end of the cable into another USB port.
