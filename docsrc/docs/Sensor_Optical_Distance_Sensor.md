# **Optical Distance Sensor (45-2006)**
-----
The Optical Distance Sensor (ODS) is an analog sensor that uses electro optical proximity detection to calculate distance from an object based on the intensity of the light. This sensor can calculate distances between 1cm to 15cm. Lighter colored objects will return a more accurate and consistent reading, the material also plays a part on the returned value. Try different colors and material to see what works best for you. The ODS can be used for object detection, line detection and the difference between light and dark.
