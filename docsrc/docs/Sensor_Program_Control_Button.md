The Program Control Button was originally designed for another controller but can be used on the Fusion as a standard push button. It can be used for an array of different tasks including program start/stop button, a mode changer, and various other user interface devices. The sensor can be attached to either an analog or digital port and contains a built-in LED which indicates when the sensor is activated. When the button is pressed, the value returned is 1. When the button is not pressed, the value returned is 0.
