# **A/V RCA 3.5mm Connector**
-----
The A/V RCA 3.5mm connector is a composite audio/video connection that can be used as an alternate to HDMI, however it is not recommended for use with the Fusion at this time. Support for this port will be supported in a future release.  
**It is recommended that [HDMI](#hdmi-port) be used for video and audio output**.

The black 3.5mm jack connects to the 3.5mm port on the side of the Fusion. The yellow, white and red connectors connect to the corresponding colored ports on a display device such as a television.
