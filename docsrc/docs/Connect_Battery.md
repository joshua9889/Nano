## **How to connect the battery**
>Connect the Fusion Battery pack for a truly wireless experience. The Fusion uses a 6V 2200mAh Ni-MH battery with a polarized connection designed to have the power on the left and the ground on the right. The battery has a keyed connection that only allows for it to be connected to the battery port in one direction.
