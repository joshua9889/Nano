The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is an audio/video cable that connects to devices like a computer monitor or television. The cable is multi-directional so either end can be connected to the Fusion.

If the Fusion is connected via HDMI it is possible to boot into the operating system and use the controller via the desktop. There is still access to the web interface that can be accessed via typing the local host. address into the address bar.
