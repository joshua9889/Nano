# **Wi-Fi Hub**
-----
The Fusion Controller acts as a Wi-Fi access point. Computers or phones can be used to search for local access points and find the Fusion Access Point by a unique SSID (name). Since the programming device (i.e. computer) is connected via Wi-Fi to the Fusion, there is no internet access.

If internet access is needed, a Wi-Fi dongle (available from Boxlight Robotics) can be connected to any of the available ports on the [USB Hub](USB_Hub.md). With the Wi-Fi dongle connected, the Fusion can connect to a wireless router.
