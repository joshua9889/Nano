# **Magnetic Sensor (45-2020)**
-----
The Magnetic Sensor detects a magnetic field and returns the strength based on the distance between the sensor element and the magnet. The default returned by the sensor when no magnetic field is present is approximately 340. When the returned value is increasing, the sensor is detecting the "North Pole" of the magnet. If the value returned is decreasing, then the sensor is detecting the "South Pole" of the magnet.
