# **Ethernet Port**
-----
The Fusion has one ethernet port for directly connecting to the internet. We recommend using a CAT5e or CAT6 ethernet cable.

One option to access to the internet is to connect an ethernet cable from the router (or modem) to the Fusion. Once the cable is connected, the Fusion will [connect to the internet](Connect_Internet.md) automatically.
