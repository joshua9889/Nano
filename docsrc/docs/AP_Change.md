# **Change Fusion Access Point SSID and Passkey**
-----
## **Custom access point and passkey**
>Each Fusion has its own unique access point name, or Service Set Identifier (SSID), and share a common passkey. There is an option in the settings menu to change your SSID and passkey.  

>**1.** Open the Fusion settings from the hamburger menu on the left or the settings box on the home page.

>**3.** In the **Access Point Settings** section, enter in a new SSID and passkey into the corresponding text boxes.  

>>*Example:*  
>>SSID: **HelloWorld**  
>>Passkey: **mynewpassword**

>**4.** Click the **APPLY CHANGES** button to apply the changes to your Fusion.

## **Can't connect to new access point**
>If you changed your SSID and Passkey and are now unable to connect to your Fusion, a few things could have gone wrong.

>**1.** [Power off](Power_Off.md) your Fusion and then turn it back on. Then attempt to connect to the Fusion using your credentials.

>**2.** If that is still not working, you may have accidentally entered your password incorrectly or the caps lock on when you entered in the new password. 

>* Follow the instructions to [Restore SSID and Passkey](AP_Restore.md) to default using the supplied [System Recovery Wire](img/Web/WiFiSettings/System_Restore_Wire.png).
