# **Robot Building Instructions**
-----
The Fusion Controller is complimented with a versatile and robust metal building system. The building system features 4mm holes placed on a standard 8mm by 8mm grid to simplify adding mechanical parts and sensors. In addition to a variety of sensors, we have a number of 3D printable parts designs which can be downloaded and printed to expand the capabilities and learning opportunities of your robot.

## *Legacy Build Instructions* ##
If you have an Original MyBot Base Kit and need to review the instructions or update your unit to accommodate the Planetary Exploration Sensor Pack, please use the links below. Original Base Kit builds are easily identified by looking at the motor mounting brackets; if they touch the 3 hole by 5 hole plates, your kit was built using the original instructions.  Complete step-by-step modification instructions are provided to add the Planetary Exploration Sensor Pack to your original base kit.
