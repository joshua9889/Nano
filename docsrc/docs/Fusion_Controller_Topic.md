# **Fusion Controller Reference**
-----
The Fusion Controller is an intelligent backpack board combined with the power of the Raspberry Pi 3, built into a robust and durable housing. The Fusion comes with a wide assortment of ports capable of supporting motors, servos and various types of sensors.    
Connect to the Fusion with a web browser on any device that has Wi-Fi. Program the robot using a visual block programming environment called [Blockly](Blockly.md), or test your skills in programming languages such as Python in our [Editor](Editor.md) environment.
