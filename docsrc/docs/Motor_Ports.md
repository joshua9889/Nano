# **Motor Ports**
-----
There are 2 motor ports for controlling 6V DC motors. Connecting the motors in reverse polarity will switch the direction of motor rotation and will not cause any damage to the controller or the motors.

>**Power** : 6V DC  
>**Current Limit** : 1.5A max  
>**Operation Frequency** : 800Hz PWM  
>**Stop Modes** : Float / Brake  
>**Ports** : M0 - M1
