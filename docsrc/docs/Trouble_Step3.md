##Getting Started Trouble Shooting - Step 3: Connect##
If your computer/device is not able to connect to the Fusion's Access Point, please check these items:  
>
>
- Make sure you are connected to the correct Access Point.  Confirm that you have entered the proper Passkey and that the computer has finished the negotiation process of connecting to the wireless network.
>  
- If you are unable to find or identify the Fusion Access Point:  
 1. Check with your robot administrator to make sure the SSID and Passkey have not been changed.  
 >
 2. Confirm that the WiFi in your computer is compatible with IEEE-802.11b, g, or n.  802.11ac is not supported.  
 >
 3. Confirm that a Mimio MicroCloud or MyBot Classroom Server is running in your vicinity.  One way is to look for a WiFi network called "MyBot Community WiFi".  This would indicate that a  Mimio MicroCloud or MyBot Classroom Server **is active** in your vicinity.  Check with your robot administrator to get the credentials to login to the MyBot Community Network to access the Fusion.  *(If these devices are operating near the Fusion Controller, it will detect them and will use its internal WiFi interface to connect to the MyBot Community WiFi Network and cannot activate the internal Access Point.)*
