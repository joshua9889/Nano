# **Editor Reference**
-----
The Editor is a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) targeted to more advanced users. The programming language Fusion currently supports is Python, but will soon support other languages.  

A basic understanding of text-based coding and the syntax for the selected programming language is needed to use the Editor IDE.

>1) **Program Environment**
>>* This is the space which contains the user code. This space supports syntax highlighting for the selected language.
>
>2) **Working Files**
>>* Contains a list of open files. Files can be easily switched between without any loss of data. A * next to s file name indicated that it has not been saved.
>
>3) **Program Output** 
>>* Displays the output of the program generated using the print statement or an error from the Controller.
>
>4) **Toolbar**
>>* **File Name** - The name of the file that is selected in the Working Files and open in the Program Environment.
>>* **File** - Gives the option to Create, Open, Close, Save, Delete and Print a file.
>>* **Manage** - Import or Export a file.
>>* **Help** - Access controller and sensor examples as well as a link to the documentation.
>>![](img/Editor/toolbar.PNG)
>>* **New File** - Opens a new file with Fusion import and driver lines in code.
>>* **Open File** - Open a file that exists in the current user's file directory.
>>* **Save File** - Save the current file that is highlighted in Working Files.
>>* **Save All Files** - Save all the current files the Working Files.
>>* **Run Program** - Run the current program that is highlighted in Working Files.
>>* **Stop Program** - Stop the current running program.
>>* **Open Virtual Gamepad** - Open the Virtual Gamepad in a new tab. (Must run the program first)
