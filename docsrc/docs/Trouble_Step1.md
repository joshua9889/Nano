##Getting Started Trouble Shooting - Step 1: Attach##
If the Green LED near the microUSB connector does not light when the cable is connected between your computer and the Fusion, please check the following:  
>
>
- Is the cable good?  It is possible that the cable is damaged and power is not being transferred to the Fusion Controller.  Please try a known good cable of good quality.  
>  
- Is the USB Port on the computer working properly and able to supply 5v @ 500mA?  Some computers limit the power available via USB ports and will not be able to power the Fusion Controller.  Please try connecting your Fusion to a different device or USB Power supply rated for at least 5v @ 500mA.  
>  
- Does the light 'flicker', especially if the microUSB connector is tapped or **gently** wiggled?  This is an indication that the microUSB cable on the connector may be damaged and cannot make reliable contact.  Please try a new, known good cable.
